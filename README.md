This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on classifying email or SMS messages as spam or not spam. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

Key components of the project include:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: Tokenization, stop words removal, and stemming using NLTK.
Exploratory data analysis: Visualization of data distribution, word clouds, and statistical summaries.
Model training and evaluation: Utilizing various classifiers including SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Stacking Classifier.
Deployment: Deployment of the best-performing model using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
Please feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Contributions are also welcome!
